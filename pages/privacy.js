              {renderListItems(dataFromParticipants)}

            Both categories of data are explicitly asked for and provided by you through our forms or email communications.
            <Title3>Primary data</Title3>
            We collect primary data in order to organize our event and meet the expectations of our participants. This includes data like
            long answer questions from student applicants, shift scheduling information from volunteers, and prize details from sponsors.
            <Title3>Survey data</Title3>
            We may ask for optional survey data in our forms to help us better understand our participants and identify ways to improve our event and services.
            Survey data will always be explicitly labelled as such and will not influence individual decision-making, such as your eligibility at the events.
            <Title3>Third-party data</Title3>
            We use the data we receive from third parties solely for identification purposes in order to provide sign-in access to our websites. If a participant chooses to sign in via a Google account, we receive the name, email address, and OAuth2 credentials of the account. We will not execute any actions on behalf of the user. You can review, adjust your privacy settings,
            or unlink your account from within your Google privacy settings.

            We collect various data during our events to improve our events and ensure a great experience for everyone.

          We may, with your explicit consent, share your personal data with select third parties and sponsors to improve your experience
          with our event. This has historically included, for example, providing your resume to sponsors for hiring and recruitment purposes. We will always, in plain english,
          inform you of why we are collecting and how we may share any piece of personal data at the point that information is entered.
          <Title3> Sharing of anonymous data </Title3>
          We may periodically release aggregate, anonymous data to both the general public and our partners for marketing, transparency,
          and sponsorship purposes. This may, for example, include data on the general geographical distribution of hackers and the number of people who have applied to the events.
